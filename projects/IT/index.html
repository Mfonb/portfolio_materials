                <p>The project focussed on developing a game which allow users to guess a randomly generated number by the App
                    from a random range of numbers.The App produces feedbacks of rewards or retrials to the user instigated by the
                    input provided the user.
                </p>
                <p>The App returns a reward to the user if the user accurately guessed the number generated by the algorithm.
                    If the number returned by the user as a guess was not in range asked, the user is asked to retry with a 
                    valid input.
                </p>
                <p>The App also tracks the number of guesses made the user, along with the number of correct guesses. However, 
                    the number of correct guesses and the trials could be reset and count would begin at zero.

                <p>The project was aimed at writing a code capable of getting specify weather details a towns (chosen by user) 
                    in the United Kingdom through an API (Application Programming Interface) source. The API source was the OpenWeather
                    Map. The python built weather App first gets name of user, then welcomes to user to the App. 
                    The user is later prompted to input the name of the city of which wearther information the user seeks. 
                    The App returns the Current Temperature, Weather Condition, Wind Speed, and Humidity of the entered city. 
                    Finally, the App expresses gratitude to the user for using the App on closing.
                </p>
                <p>The App handles errors of input by the user. Users are asked to retry city name entry if an invalid city 
                    is entered by the user. Download a ReadMe file containing a code of the project below.

                <p>In this project, a database which tracks the inventory, customer data, and sale transactions of 
                    an e-commerce store was designed. The aim of the database was to help the store manage 
                    products, organise information of customers, and for the analysis of sale performances. 
                    In that respect, the project involved the certifications of tables, defination of relationships, 
                    insertion of data to the database, and writing of queries in the extraction of 
                    meaningful insights from the database.
